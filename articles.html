                    <hr>
                    <p>African media has a sexual harassment problem. But many cases of physical and verbal sexual harassment go unreported because of fear of further victimisation and a lack of confidence in management systems and interventions. When action is taken, results are often underwhelming.</p>
                    <p>WIN’s latest research, the first phase of a multi-region study, set out to collect credible information about the scale of harassment in news outlets in Africa and to establish what was being done to provide safer newsrooms.</p>

                        responded to questions on sexual harassment at work - verbal

                          About 47% of women had been sexually harassed at work, while 43%
                          of gender non conforming individuals and 19.5% of men said they
                          had faced unwanted sexual attention.

                          harassment, while 38% reported physical sexual harassment. For

                          and 36%&nbsp; had faced physical harassment. Some 24% of male
                          respondents experienced verbal sexual harassment and 15%

                          Almost half, 46.12%, had witnessed at least one incident of

                        <strong>Fear</strong> prevented many from filing formal
                        complaints. These were the common concerns:&nbsp;

                        inaction.&nbsp;
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Almost half, 46.7%, of those surveyed said their organisation had
                        no sexual harassment policy, 35.9% were unaware of what was in the
                        policy and just 17.4% were aware of its contents.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Of the 32 managers interviewed 68.7% said their organisation had a
                        sexual harassment policy - 46.7% had been trained on it.&nbsp;

                      <p>
                        Perhaps the biggest impedance in reporting is that the
                        <strong>perpetrators are often managers</strong> or supervisors -
                        people with responsibility and power. Survey respondents
                        identified their harassers as fellow employees (in 38% of cases)
                        but 21,5% of the time they were direct supervisors and in 19.5% of
                        cases, members of higher management.

                      <p>
                        When action was taken in 42% of cases reported, the most common
                        organisational responses were to warn the perpetrator (42%), offer
                        emotional support for the participant (12.7%), dismiss the case
                        after review (12.5%), and provide training for staff about sexual
                        harassment (9%)

                      <h1 class="text-center">Management Shortcomings</h1>
                      <p>“The research highlights a lack of trust in the organisation, or sometimes complete failure of management and systems, to deal effectively with sexual harassment,” said Melanie Walker, WAN-IFRA’s Executive Director, Media Development and Women in News.</p>
                      <p>“This matters because the less confidence there is in an organisation’s ability to address the problem, fewer people will see value in calling it out, and so the cycle will perpetuate.” There are solutions, however, beginning with owners and managers acknowledging the problem exists and then committing to ensuring a safer working space, not just for women, but for all staff. It is vitally important to change the culture of silence around harassment. And this culture change can only come from the very top.”</p>
                      <hr>
                      <h1 class="text-center">What Managers Say</h1>
                      <p>In supplementary interviews with 32 media managers, we found </p>
                      <ul class="bulleted-list">
                        <li>
                          Almost half the managers,46%, said they felt the industry no
                          longer has a sexual harassment problem.&nbsp;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Yet more than half of those interviewed, 53%, had themselves
                          been the target of harassment. This figure is in line with the
                          overall prevalence found in the survey.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Less than 10% of managers had reported the issue - this is much
                          lower than the overall trend of 30%.
                        </li>

                      <h1 class="text-center">Making Sense of Divergent Realities</h1>
                      <p>“There are divergent views on the scale of sexual harassment between the survey respondents and managers we interviewed. There is no simple explanation for this - but what is common is that both staff and managers have had first-hand experience of sexual harassment, and in most cases chose not to report it. This suggests fear of victimisation runs alongside a lack of confidence in management systems and any apparent remedies,” said Walker.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Women in News, which offers expert input on how to manage sexual harassment, is starting to see little victories among those media organisations that have begun to actively manage the problem - starting with adopting policies and procedures that the staff can support. “But the numbers are very small and we have a very long way to go before staff are convinced and comfortable that if there are incidents of harassment, they can report them, and action will be taken, without further victimisation,” said Jane Godia, Africa Director of WIN and an expert and trainer managing sexual harassment.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “We are still working on changing perceptions and debunking cultural beliefs that perpetuate sexual harassment,” said Godia.

                        Conclusion
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        This research has provided evidence of the need for media organisations to recognise the extent of sexual harassment and put in plans steps to provide a safer working environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It all starts with a conversation on what is and isn’t acceptable behaviour in your media organisation. - being explicit about sexual harassment - sharing definitions, what behaviours are unacceptable, and communicating the right for every employee to be treated equally. It is not enough to have a policy; staff and managers must be trained on what the procedures are for making and managing a complaint. Everyone should be clear about the consequences of sexual harassment. It is far better to be proactive and prepared than pushed into a crisis management position when a case emerges,” said Walker.
